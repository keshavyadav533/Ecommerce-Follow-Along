### 🚀 Project Overview
Provide a brief introduction to the project. Mention its purpose, key features, and technologies used.

### 📂 Folder Structure
Explain the directory layout of your project for easy navigation.

```
project-folder/
│-- 📂 controllers/   # Handles request logic
│-- 📂 models/        # Defines database schemas
│-- 📂 routes/        # Manages API endpoints
│-- 📂 middlewares/   # Custom middleware functions

│-- 📂 config/        # Configuration files (e.g., database connection)
│-- 📜 server.js      # Main server entry point
```

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions
Provide step-by-step guidance on how to set up the project.

#### 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.

#### 📝 Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on the designated port (e.g., `3000`).

### 🗄 Database Connection
Provide details on how to connect the project to a database.

- The database is managed using **MongoDB**.
- Connection settings are defined in `config/db.js`.
- Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the project.

### ⚠️ Error Handling
Explain how errors are handled in the project.

#### ✅ Best Practices
- Provide clear error messages.
- Implement a global error handler in Express.
- Use `try/catch` blocks for async functions.

#### 🛠 Example Middleware
```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ message: "🚨 Internal Server Error" });
});
```

### 🔜 Next Steps
